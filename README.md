# Text-to-speech-app
This is a basic app for kids or teens who cannot able to speak. So to express them what they want to say they simply type and this app will speak for them.
Instead of typing there are some icons which shows some daily life needs by given on clicking them they can express themselves. I am using Web Speech API for Speech Synthesis. 
You can read about it from here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API
